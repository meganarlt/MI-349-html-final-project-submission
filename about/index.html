  <p>
    <br><br>
    
    Welcome.<br><br>

    My name is Megan, and I am currently a senior at Michigan State University.<br><br>

    After 4 years of studying Applied Engineering with a concentration in 
    Computer Science and an Engineering Internship I switched my major 
    to Media and Information with a minor in Graphic Design. I couldnâ€™t 
    be happier about the change.<br><br>

    I am a hard working individual with a great attention to detail. I enjoy 
    new and challenging projects that push me to learn more in the great 
    field of design. Through college and previous work experiences, I
    have gained great time management skills that allow me to work on 
    multiple projects at once.<br><br>

    In my free time I enjoy just about anything that involves the outdoors.
